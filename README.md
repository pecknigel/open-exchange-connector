# Open Exchange Connector

This is an implementation of the data access layer for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

It constitutes a network API providing connections to data services.

See [Data Access Layer](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#data-access-layer) for more about the system layer that this project implements.

See [Data Access Layer Interface Agreements](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#data-access-layer-interface) for specification of the interface that this should provide.

## What’s all this about?

It’s all part of a [collaborative project](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) for learning web development and software engineering. All backed by a highly experienced teacher who has stepped away after twenty years in software development to concentrate on teaching.

Mentoring is available as needed, seven days a week.

See [Prescription Free Academy](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).
